MIPS Assembler
==============

This is an implementation of a MIPS assembler specifically for use by our VHDL MIPS processor.

The program takes as input a MIPS assembly program, and outputs an ascii binary file.

Additionally, two test files are provided with the program: `fib.asm` and `bitwise.asm`.
